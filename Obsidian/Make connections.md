### Like the brain, how you connect the dots, or make connections inside the brain.

### Points
1. Just use [[I have made a connection]] and write the word inside, this word will be now a new topic that you can write more information about.
2. **Reverse Links**: just link back the same file using the same bracket philosophy.
3. How to beautify?
	1. The link: [[]]
	2. The tag: #pragramttic  , they essentially reference the same point you want to make in all the files, one good example for this would be using #Important_code 
	3. Italic: As we type and we want to emphasize something we just add \*This means italic\*.
	4. For bold: \** Bold this statement\**
	5. For making lists:
	   - Add hypens
	6. Headers : use \# and then a space key. 
	7.  You have 6 levels for this.(just increase the number of \#
